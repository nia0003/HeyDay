# **Hey Day**
War Eagle and welcome to a beloved tradition of Auburn University: [**Hey Day**](http://sga.auburn.edu/hey-day/)!
## What is **Hey Day**?
**Hey Day** is a celebration of the Auburn Family. 
The tradition dates back to 1947, serving as a day where every student gets the opportunity to wear a name tag, to be greeted, and to be reminded that they belong here at Auburn.

The **Hey Day** script imitates the customs of Hey Day - Enter your name and you will be greeted! 

Come join us for this year's **Hey Day** on October 12.
Grab a name tag so we can celebrate you and your contributions to the Auburn family!
